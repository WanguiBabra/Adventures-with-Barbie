                      <p class="blog-subtitle">Nairobi Design Week 2024 was hosted from 9th to 17th March at Opportunity Factory Ridge, Mbagath Ridge, Karen. One of the core themes this year was empowering the youth to be champions of sustainability. The idea behind this is building a circular eco-system in Kenya through textile collections and upcycling. Lots of creators and designers were present showcasing their art and the venue was packed with like-minded people in the world of fashion design. I particularly loved the collections by the 'Endo sisters'. Their 'Endo-squared' designs were so beautiful and included clothes and accessories such as jewelleries. Let me know who your favourite designer was and their collection</p>
